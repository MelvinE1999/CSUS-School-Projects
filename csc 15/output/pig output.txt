 ----jGRASP exec: java pig
*******************************************************************************
****
*	You are about to play the pig game against the 
computer.
*	On each turn, the current player will roll a pair of
dice.
*	and acumulates points. The goal is to reach to 40
points.
*	before your opponent does. If, on any turn, the player 
roll
*	all the points accumulated for that round are forfeited
and
*	the control of the dice moves to the other player. If the
player
*	rolls two 1s in one turn , the player loses all the 
points
*	accumulated thus far and forfeit and the control moves to
the
*	other player. The player may voluntarily turn over the dice 
after
*	each roll. Therefore player must decide to roll again(be a
pig)
*	and risk losing points , or relinquish control of the dice,
possibly
*	allowing the other player to 
win.
*	Computer is going to flip a coin to choose the  first 
player
